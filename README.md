# Library Management System

Hello! Welcome to my repository. This project was built as part of [Frappe's Dev Hiring Test](https://frappe.io/dev-hiring-test). As outlined in their assignment, this is a Library Management System which supports:
- Basic [CRUD] operations on Books and Members.
- Issuing books to members
- Returning books from members
- Charging rent on return.
- Ensuring the debt does not go above Rs. 500.

Additionally, a librarian is able to maintain:
- Books
- Members
- Transactions
- Reports on popular books and highest paying members

The application is compatible with Frappe's API, which is used for importing Books.
